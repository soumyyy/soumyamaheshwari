## Introduction

I've wanted to create this blog-site for a while now, perpetually I've been in this coding rut since my vacation started, and I found coding this blog-site was the best way to break out of it.

Technical alert: for the past couple of month I've entirely switched from apple notes, (and bunch of other note taking apps) to **Obsidian**. I found the markdown format very appealing, and how i can just push it on a private git repository. Now I just write down everything in my Obsidian notes for markdown convenience and just push it to gh, and then a eleventy pipeline takes care of this blog-site generation. I also plan to create a personal RAG-based assistant(or something better) out of this data (I can do it right now as well, but I'm so sure the i wouldn't really use it).

As for what I’ll be writing about - I have no solid plan for what I'm going to write about, I guess amalgamation and bits of some sensible thoughts and some random musings. With time hoping it becomes a public diary my knowledge garden of sorts. In all honesty I’m not publishing this to create a solid audience, or even to be particularly useful. But because it's gonna hold me accountable and articulate better.

 I'll make a hard rule of making this a place where I strictly don't write using LLMs. Because I've gotten embarrassingly bad at simple writing since school and chatgpt just like all of us.
 
 That's about it for the introduction.
