# soumyamaheshwari.com

My personal portfolio website, designed to be minimal, interactive, and space-themed. Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## About Me

i’m soumya. i design, i build, and i mess with things just to see how they work. spent a couple years in startup ops & strategy, but recently i've put most of my energy in the deep end: ai tooling, agents, and the chaos of the new.

i'm a compulsive tinkerer. obsessed with the entire process of how things are built, curious about any and everything. i dig into everything: cloud, infra, devops, ml. i don't just skim the surface; i live in the weeds.
